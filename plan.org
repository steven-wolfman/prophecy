* First pass
Simple ring-shaped board with 20 spaces and k players. A player on
their turn can move to a neighboring space. Goal is to move to a
designated target space.

Simplifications:
+ Make the board 20 spaces around the edge of a 6x6 grid, leaving the interior empty. No need in that case to figure out how to do non-grid boards. *BUT*, this will eventually be important; so, worth figuring out earlier rather than later.
+ Allow exactly two players only.
